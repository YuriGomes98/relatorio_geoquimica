## Introduction

This report brings a summary of the South America's deposits of Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe) and Lithium (Li) contained in the Critical Minerals Mapping Initiative (CMMI) database, a collection of geochemical analysis of 7,000 samples from mineral deposits in 60 countries.

Geoscience Australia, the Geological Survey of Canada, and the US Geological Survey compiled CMMI from publicly available sources, including mineral deposit, geochemistry, and the OSNACA databases.

This report is for education and science communication only.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
